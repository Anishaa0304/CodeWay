    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>I aspire to become a person who gives their best in eberything they do and tries to improve themselves every day. A person who is not afraid to take on new challenges and exploring themselves. 
        I want to make painting, learn to play guitar, learn to cook and ride a scooty, sing my heart out, and cherish every moment I spend. I want to become a person who can control and discipline their mind. I want to code, learn about finances and take leadership positions. </p>
